However, it is often overlooked by programmers who choose or stick with RDBMS stores. This is the audience I would like to dedicate this short write-up to.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I have nothing against relational databases. In fact, I have been working with them (particularly with Oracle) since I can remember, and this post only promotes them more.</description></item><item><title>Unlocking the Power of InnerSource: Key Strategies You Can't Ignore</title><link>https://przemek.malirz.pl/en/blog/unlocking-the-power-of-inner-source/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://przemek.malirz.pl/en/blog/unlocking-the-power-of-inner-source/</guid><description>I know that I should start with the definition of InnerSource.

I am an architect and a programmer with a background in designing and implementing various-sized systems. I have gained expertise across several industries such as surveying, graphics, telecommunications, insurance, and financial services. My goal is to create a practical and secure architecture that facilitates project development and maintenance while minimizing incidents.
As a technical leader, I also manage distributed and multicultural teams. I participate in all stages of the project development cycle - from cost estimation and business analysis to design, full-stack programming, testing, deployment, and production maintenance.</description></item></channel></rss>
