## Bio

My name is **Przemek Malirz**. I am an architect and a programmer with a background in designing and implementing
various-sized systems. I have gained expertise across several industries such as surveying, graphics,
telecommunications, insurance, and financial services. My goal is to create a practical and secure architecture that
facilitates project development and maintenance while minimizing incidents.

As a technical leader, I also manage distributed and multicultural teams. I participate in all stages of the project
development cycle - from cost estimation and business analysis to design, full-stack programming, testing, deployment,
and production maintenance.

I am an enthusiastic advocate of [InnerSource](https://innersourcecommons.org/ "InnerSource") development practices and
a promoter of Clean Code and DevOps culture. I strive to build open teams and break down silo boundaries through
open collaboration and communication.

## Contact me

I have decided to conduct trainings and consultations primarily because I enjoy working with people and helping them.

I invite **companies, groups, and individuals** (remotely and on site) to contact me.
I offer **consultations, presentations, trainings, workshops, mentoring**.

Wondering if programming is for you? Are you just starting your career and want to
with certain topics, or maybe you lack confidence in some technologies and want to confront or complement your
knowledge? Don't hesitate any longer!

Interested in preparing workshops, trainings, or presentations at a **university or company**? I'd be happy to help.

I'm also prepared for a professional preparation of a topic chosen by you, which I do not directly have in my offer, but
which is in my experience. It's just a matter of systematizing knowledge into an easily digestible form.

I invite you for **consultations, presentations, trainings, workshops, mentoring, and reading my subjective blog**.
Connecting and networking only helps, so be sure to find me at:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pmalirz)
* Facebook (wip)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/przemyslawmalirz/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/pmalirz/)

* ‚òéÔ∏è [(+48) 608411472](tel:+48608411472)

[On the main page](/en/) I will gradually add the available offers. You can already inquire about each item, but since
I suffer from annoying perfectionism, I need some time to prepare each position properly.

## Qualifications

Since I also offer my services to private individuals, I have decided to provide more detailed information about my
experiences below. This way you can check if I can help you with the chosen technology.

I will prepare consultations, trainings or workshops for the selected topics and can also profile them for the target
group (programmers, testers, analysts, managers).
